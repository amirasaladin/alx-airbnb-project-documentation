# üìò Airbnb Clone Backend ‚Äì Project Requirements

## üéØ Objective

Learners will identify and document the key features and functionalities of the Airbnb Clone backend by understanding the technical and functional requirements necessary for building a scalable, secure, and robust system.

---

## üìö Introduction

Backend development involves creating the server-side logic, database management, and API integrations that power a web application. This document outlines the **backend requirements** for the Airbnb Clone project, focusing on key features that make the app functional, user-friendly, and efficient.

The requirements are divided into:

- üîë Core Functionalities  
- üõ†Ô∏è Technical Requirements  
- üöÄ Non-Functional Requirements  

---

## üîë Core Functionalities

### 1. User Management

- **User Registration**  
  - Sign up as guest or host  
  - Use secure authentication (JWT)

- **User Login and Authentication**  
  - Login via email/password  
  - OAuth options (Google, Facebook)

- **Profile Management**  
  - Update profile photo, contact info, and preferences

---

### 2. Property Listings Management

- **Add Listings**  
  - Hosts can provide title, description, location, price, amenities, and availability

- **Edit/Delete Listings**  
  - Hosts can modify or remove listings

---

### 3. Search and Filtering

- **Filters:**  
  - Location  
  - Price range  
  - Number of guests  
  - Amenities (Wi-Fi, pool, pet-friendly)

- **Pagination**  
  - For large datasets

---

### 4. Booking Management

- **Booking Creation**  
  - Guests can book for specific dates  
  - Prevent double bookings via date validation

- **Booking Cancellation**  
  - Allow guests or hosts to cancel based on policy

- **Booking Status Tracking**  
  - Pending, Confirmed, Cancelled, Completed

---

### 5. Payment Integration

- **Secure Payments**  
  - Stripe, PayPal for guest payments

- **Host Payouts**  
  - Automatic after booking is completed

- **Currency Support**  
  - Support for multiple currencies

---

### 6. Reviews and Ratings

- Guests can leave reviews (linked to specific bookings)  
- Hosts can respond to reviews  
- Prevent abuse by associating reviews with actual bookings

---

### 7. Notifications System

- **Trigger Events:**  
  - Booking confirmations  
  - Cancellations  
  - Payment updates

- **Channels:**  
  - Email  
  - In-app notifications

---

### 8. Admin Dashboard

Admins can monitor and manage:

- Users  
- Listings  
- Bookings  
- Payments

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Requirements

### 1. Database Management

- Use **PostgreSQL** or **MySQL**
- Tables:
  - Users (guests and hosts)
  - Properties
  - Bookings
  - Reviews
  - Payments

---

### 2. API Development

- Use **RESTful APIs**
- Methods and Status Codes:
  - `GET` (retrieve data)
  - `POST` (create data)
  - `PUT/PATCH` (update data)
  - `DELETE` (remove data)

- Optional: **GraphQL** for complex data queries

---

### 3. Authentication and Authorization

- **JWT** for session management  
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
  - Guest  
  - Host  
  - Admin

---

### 4. File Storage

- Store property images and profile photos using:
  - Cloud storage services like **AWS S3** or **Cloudinary**
  - For this project, local file storage will be used

---

### 5. Third-Party Services

- Use **SendGrid** or **Mailgun** for email notifications

---

### 6. Error Handling and Logging

- Implement global error handling for API endpoints

---

## üöÄ Non-Functional Requirements

### 1. Scalability

- Use **modular architecture**  
- Enable **horizontal scaling** via load balancers

---

### 2. Security

- Encrypt sensitive data (passwords, payment info)  
- Implement **rate limiting**, **firewalls**, and other protections

---

### 3. Performance Optimization

- Use **Redis** caching for frequently accessed data (e.g., search results)  
- Optimize database queries

---

### 4. Testing

- Use testing frameworks like **pytest**  
- Include:
  - Unit tests  
  - Integration tests  
  - Automated API tests

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

This document outlines all backend requirements to build a production-ready Airbnb Clone backend. It covers core functionalities such as user and property management, technical specs like authentication and APIs, and non-functional aspects including performance and security.
